## üõ†Ô∏è Functions Overview

### Public Functions

* `tip(recipient, amount, token-type)`
  Tip another user using a valid token. Auto deducts platform fee and updates all stats.

* `update-user-reward-points(user, reward-rate)`
  Admin-only: manually updates a user's reward points.

* `set-user-identity(user, username)`
  User-only: register a verifiable and unique username.

### Read-Only Functions

* `get-user-tip-stats(user)`
  View total tips sent, received, and reward points.

* `get-user-identity(user)`
  Retrieve a user‚Äôs registered username.

* `get-total-tips-sent(sender)`
  View total tips sent by a user.

* `get-total-tips-received(recipient)`
  View total tips received by a user.

* `get-reward-points(sender, amount)`
  Simulate reward point update if user tips a specific amount.

* `get-tip-amount(amount)`
  Validate a tip amount.

* `get-updated-platform-stats(sender, amount)`
  Preview a sender's stats after a hypothetical tip.

* `get-tips-recieved(recipient, amount)`
  Calculate actual tip amount after fee deduction.

* `get-transaction-logs(sender, recipient, amount, fee, token-type)`
  Check log entry for a specific tip.

---

## ‚úÖ Validation & Rules

* Users cannot tip themselves or the contract owner.
* Tip amount must be < 1000 STX and user must have sufficient balance.
* Only `STX` and `BTC` are accepted (for now).
* Usernames must be 3-20 characters and unique.
* Only contract owner can call `update-user-reward-points`.

---

## üîê Security Considerations

* All token transfers are wrapped in `try!` to avoid silent failures.
* All access control checks are enforced using `asserts!`.
* Invalid operations revert with descriptive error codes.

---

## üìà Example Workflow

1. Alice sets her username via `set-user-identity`.
2. Bob sends 5 STX to Alice via `tip`, paying a 5% fee.
3. Bob earns 10 reward points since the tip exceeded 1 STX.
4. The contract logs this transaction, and both users' stats are updated.

---

## üß™ Testing Tips

* Try tipping with 0.5 STX and 2 STX to test reward logic.
* Register usernames and ensure uniqueness constraints are enforced.
* Simulate reward point updates with the read-only functions before calling public ones.
